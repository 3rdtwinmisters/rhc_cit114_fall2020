# Notes 3: Cloud Global Infrastructure

### Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos. 
+ A DevOps work environment is very collaborative learning environment

#### Evolution of Work Culture 
+ Old work environment: Bad apples in the bunch are the problem
+ New work environment: We need to fix the system
+ Siloization is the process of separating and making clear distinctions between people who work on software and hardware. <br/>

#### A DevOps work culture leads to:
a. Increased transparency and trust within a team <br/>
b. Instruct our coworkers in how to avoid a costly mistake without having to
directly experience it <br/>
c. Increase the time spent on solving new problems, allowing for more innovation.<br/>

#### Four pillars of effective DevOps: 
Collaboration, Tools, Affinity, Scaling 

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
a. "If things broke, it would help prioritize the criticality of further sharing, documenting, and distributing my knowledge and expertise to the business. Ultimately, that would lead to more stability and a better overall outcome for the organization and individuals on the team" (Chapter 1). <br/>

b. "A guiding principle that shaped the devOps movement was the cooperation of software development and operations teams. Before one team can successfully work with another team with a different focus, the individuals on a team need to be able to work with each other" (Chapter 6). <br/>

### What new facts did you learn from this section?

+ Collaboration improves DevOps work cultures and implementing effective updates
+ The term DevOps itself is a portmanteau of “development” and “operations” 
+ It is important to have the right set of tools to improve the success of an organization
+ Sometimes forums, social media, or information repositories can help system admins manage servers

### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. When software was proprietary, was working with the source code limited because of it being copyrighted? <br/>

b. Did the increased use of open source software increase the collaboration between development and operations?
