# Notes 9: Cloud Architecture

### Summarize a few key points made by the readings or video
+ Five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework â€” operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.

#### General Design Principles of the Well-Architected Framework
+ Stop Guessing your capacity needs
+ Test systems at production scale
+ Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
+ Allow for evolutionary architectures
+ Drive architectures using data
+ Improve through game days

+Resource constraints is like space on a hard drive or data speed of a ethernet cable
+Mitigate deployment risk by fixing issues that don't have desired outcomes with accelerated bug fixing and quality assurance.

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
a. "Successful evolution of operations is founded in: frequent small improvements; providing safe environments and time to experiment, develop, and test improvements; and environments in which learning from failures is encouraged" (13). <br/>
b. "The optimal network solution for a workload varies based on latency, throughput requirements, jitter, and bandwidth. Physical constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine location options. These constraints can be offset with edge locations or resource placement" (28).

### What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ Security includes: the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies.
+ Human Identities: Admins, developers, operators, and end users or members of an organization.
+ Machine Identities: service applications, operation tools, and workloads require identities to secure access.

### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. Do you add business value by investing in resources to mange AWS services running a Well-Architected framwork? <br/>
b. When scaling the amount of resources has an increase of demand, does the load balancing increase its computing resources?
