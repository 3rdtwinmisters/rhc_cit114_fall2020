# Notes 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

### 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos 
+ Horizontal Scaling: scaling out and scaling in
+ Vertical Scaling: scaling up and scaling down
+ Six Advantages of Cloud Computing: Trade capital expense for variable expense, Benefit from massive economies of scale, stop guessing capacity, increase speed and agility, stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers, go global in minutes.
+ Cloud Deployment Models: Cloud, Hybrid and On-Premises or Private Cloud.

### 2. Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.

a. "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models" (2.1). <br/>
b. "Runtime failures that are not immediately corrected can have a more significant impact during high-volume usage periods. Not only is the IT resource unable to respond to customer requests, its unexpected failure can decrease overall customer confidence" (2.4).

### 3. What new facts did you learn from this section
a. Clouds can be for public use, like the Internet, and private clouds allow users to access privately owned internet resources such as documents accessed through the internet. <br/>
b. Cloud consumers experience decreased portability moving data from one cloud provider to another cloud provider's services. <br/>
c. SaaS applications, such as Microsoft 365, overall performance relies heavily on a user's internet performance. SaaS is often end-user applications often maintained by the service provider. <br/>
d. The On Premises cloud model, or private cloud, doesn't provide all the benefits of cloud computing but is utilized because of its ability to provide on premise resources.

### 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. Has modern day computing technology become a utility like electricity and water? If so, can the laws and regulations applied to utilities be applied to computing technology?
