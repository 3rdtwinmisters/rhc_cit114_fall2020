### Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos. 
+ RAM temporarily stores data while the computer is powered on; temporary saved data is lost when powered off.
Cloud storage is data storage as a service.
+ Cloud storage is data storage as a service.
+ Amazon S3 is an object storage service that is scalable secure, and has high performance.
+ S3 Glacier is good for storing files that need to be saved but not always accessed
+ Bulk Retrievals are the lowest cost S3 glacier service usually complete in 5-12 hours.

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting. 
+ "Disaster recovery (DR) starts with a plan that works in conjunction with the business continuity and contingency plans" (9.02)
+ "To store and access data in Amazon S3 Glacier, you can use the AWS Management Console. However, only a few operations—such as creating and deleting vaults, and creating and managing archive policies—are available in the console" (9.10)

### What new facts did you learn from this section.
a. Volatile storage (RAM) vs. Non-Volatile storage (HDD SSD) <br/>
b. SSD storage is fast reliable, and uses less power than HDD storage <br/>
c. HDD cost less than SSD especially for larger storage drives. <br/>
d. Fault Tolerance is a system designed to reduce failure. <br/>
e. Cipher text is encrypted text


### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. Can an AWS services or other object storage tools be used to backup data not only to the cloud but also a on premises data center?  <br/>
b. Does the region used for AWS services affect how long it takes to retrieve data from an S3 bucket or S3 Glacier?
