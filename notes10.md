# Notes 10: Automatic Scaling & Monitoring

### Summarize a few key points made by the readings or video
+ Cloud applications change on demand to provide the right level of performance needed to complete a task.
+ Cloudwatch offers basic monitoring services of certain metrics free of charge when using AWS services.
+ Connection draining is closing new request to an unhealthy instance and let existing request finish task.
+ Load balancing regulates network traffic; AWS charges by each load balancer and load capacity units  (LCU) used.
+ Load Balancing Options: the Application Load Balancer (ALB), the Network Load Balancer (NLB), and the Classic Load Balancer (CLB)

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
a. "ELB load-balancing options integrate with EC2 instances, EC2 auto scaling, Certificate Manager, CloudWatch, Route 53, and, if you’re using the ALB, you can also add a web application firewall (WAF) ACL for additional protection" (Wilkins). <br/>
b. "With sticky sessions enabled on a load balancer, after a request is routed to a target, a cookie is generated by the load balancer and returned to the client. All requests from the client from this point forward include the cookie; the information contained in the cookie ensures that the request is routed by the load balancer to the same back-end server" (Wilkins). 

### What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ ALB (Application Load Balancer) Layer 7 OSI model.
+ Human Identities: Admins, developers, operators, and end users or members of an organization.
+ Machine Identities: service applications, operation tools, and workloads require identities to secure access.
+ The CloudWatch dashboard is used to monitor metrics of each service.

### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. Can autoscaling scale with third party load balancers or does AWS services only scale based on needs?<br/>
