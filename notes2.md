# Notes 2: Cloud Economics, Billing & Support

### Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
+ With a Pay-as-you-go pricing model, costs of operation are optimized to total use.
+ There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:<br/>
a. Compute <br/>
b. Storage <br/>
c. Outbound data transfer <br/>
+ You do not pay for cloud-based resources that are not being used.
+ Components of Total Cost of Technology: <br/>
<pre/>
a. Hardware Acquisition c. Infrastructure e. Installation g. Training i. Space <br/>
b. Software Acquisition d. Downtime       f. Maintenance  h. Support  j. ELectricity <br/>


+ An Organizational Unit is a container for user accounts.
+ Allow list strategy – You explicitly specify the access that is allowed.
+ Deny list strategy – You explicitly specify the access that is not allowed.

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
a. "One of the main benefits of cloud services is the ability it gives you to optimize costs to match your needs, even as those needs change" (4.01). <br/>
b. "AWS Organizations includes account management and consolidated billing capabilities that enable you to better meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of your business. As an administrator of an organization, you can create accounts in your organization and invite existing accounts to join the organization" (4.16). <br/>

### What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ Although AWS charges for Outbound data transfer, it does not charge for inbound data transfer or transfer between other AWS services in the same region.
+ The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) estimate the cost when using cloud services hosted by a cloud provider.

### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. Can you reapply for AWS Free Tier after the initial 12 months trial period? <br/>
b. Does the TCO calculator calculate tax of services used by the region in which servers and databases are located or is it calculated by using local tax rates where the services are accessed?
