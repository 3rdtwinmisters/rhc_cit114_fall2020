### Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
+ Hackers, attackers or intruders exploit vulnerabilities in software to obtain unauthorized access of systems.
+ Steganography concealing information within another piece of information

#### Types of User Security Control Settings
+ Inherited Controls: Settings preconfigured by AWS
+ Shared Controls: Controller Settings combining customer control settings and AWS.
+ Customer Specific: Controls implemented by the customer when using AWS Cloud services.

### Identify two quotes that were made, that you found interesting.
a. "AWS Cloud Compliance enables you to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the cloud in order to achieve compliance with your solutions. As systems are built on top of AWS Cloud infrastructure, compliance responsibilities will be shared" (6.14). <br/>
b. "Some AWS Premium Support plans include access to the Trusted Advisor tool, which offers a one-view snapshot of your service and helps identify common security misconfigurations, suggestions for improving system performance, and underutilized resources" (AWS Best Security Practices).

### What new facts did you learn from this section?
+ Use strong passwords and implement MDA to minimize cybersecurity attacks
+ Try not to use shared identities for security purposes one user one IAM user account 
+ AIC triad Availability Integrity and Confidentiality
+ AWS serviced fall under three categories: Infrastructure services, Container Services, Abstracted Services.
+ AWS Account is the main account (root user) IAM users are controlled by a single AWS account
+ AWS Shield is a Ddos protection service minimizing downtime

### What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
a. How is it determined that a customer is responsible for security of information when using Cloud services? <br/>
b. Do clients need to purchase an anti-virus software if they only access Cloud Services remotely. <br/>
c. If a user needs anti-virus software when using cloud services who is responsible for providing the software: The user (employee), The Employer (Client), or the Cloud Service? <br/>
